						Regarding industry-university cooperation, NCHU will foster its connection with industries and empower industrial partners with upgraded skills and technologies, increasing the university’s brand value. Dr. Shieu promised to go deeper into local communities and take advantage of NCHU’s available resources. Locally, the school will work to procure national subsidies to improve the prosperity of the city. Further afield, NCHU will be involved with the central government's mapping of public land use, and help boost the central government’s quality of administration. “It is our responsibility to give back to society,” Dr. Shieu reminded his audience.<wbr> He asserted that NCHU would assume a think-tank role in the city’s development and play a big part in fulfilling Mayor Lin’s vision of Taichung becoming the “Capital of Good Life.”

						The current National Chung-Hsing University Library was inaugurated on 21 September 2005. Measuring 34,492 square meters, it has seven floors and a basement, with 2,100 reading seats and building-wide wireless internet access.<br>
						In 2010, the basement was redesigned from a traditional self-study area into a learning commons to provide an environment that facilitates both individual and group study. White dominates the color scheme, with wood tone and splashes of green implemented to tie a clean modern aesthetic with a hint of nature. Support columns are decorated to emulate trees branching into the ceiling. Glass walls printed with silhouettes of trees subdivide the area yet maintain the impression of accessibility.
